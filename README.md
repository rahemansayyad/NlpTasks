Here we create a model to understand the sentiments of users on the comments of the launch event of Tesla, it will help in predicting the inventory, share price around this event, and general awareness of confidence among the people which will help in forming the marketing strategy.

Data is taken from the launch video of telsa, from the youtube API. The comments are stored to a csv file.
We then take few comments out of the total collected comments and then work towards cleaning the comments.
We can also see from the word cloud and the bar plot the words that contributes the most towards the resulting sentiments.

we can use the same model for any kind of comments but thigs that need to be kept in mind is use the appropriate stop words using a proper word embedding model.
